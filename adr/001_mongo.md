# mongoDB

# Status: accepted

# Context:

MongoDB is being used as a database to store data used by the application. Persistent storage volumes are added so data will be persisted when taking the application down.

# Decision:

MongoDB provides a cross-platform database with extensive features and capabilities to store data and pair with the python flask application. MongoDB Docker containers are available on the Docker Hub.

# Consequences:

A functional database can be deployed and used without requiring much time, effort, or resources.
