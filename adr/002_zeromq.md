# ZeroMQ

# Status: accepted

# Context:

ZeroMQ is essentially an open source messaging library for applications. Paired with python, its asynchronous message passing serves as a powerful and scalable component of the application. ZeroMQ offers many features such as message queuing, one socket to many socket connections and automatic TCP connection.

# Decision:

ZeroMQ was used for the application because it is fast and simple for message passing. It supports many languages and connection patterns used for messaging. ZeroMQ's common implementation and proven success with python is another reason why it was chosen.

# Consequences:

ZeroMQ is fast and simple to implement and allows for flexibility when needed.
