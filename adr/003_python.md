# Python

# Status: accepted

# Context:

Python is a general purpose interpreted programming language. Python pairs well with Flask to provide the framework to allow requests and responses.

# Decision:

Python was chosen due to its ease of use and familiarity with the language. The flask application was able to be set up and read with relative ease and minimal code.

# Consequences:

Python files can be worked with easily and integrate well into the application and its components.
